# 42get_next_line

This is a project I did during my brief stint at 42 Belirn (Feb - August 2023).

The aim is to create a C programme, which would take a text file, and print a line of text.

A "line" ends when either:-

there a carriage return (â†µ; or more accuately newline character), or
there are no more text characters to be read.

I struggled for this for a long time, but when I finally got there the experience was rewarding.
