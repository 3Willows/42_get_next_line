# 42get_next_line

This is a project I did during my brief stint at 42 Belirn (Feb - August 2023).

The aim is to create a C programme, which would take a text file, and print a line of text.

A "line" ends when either:-

* there a carriage return (â†µ; or more accuately newline character), OR

* there are no more text characters to be read.

As with other Berlin 42 subjects, there are a number of restrictions making this very difficult for the novice.  

In particular, it is hard to understand what you are meant to achieve at first: there is a lot of missing context that needs to be filled in.  

A lot of research is required to correctly understand the question. In fact, even downloading and getting someone else's answer to work might take half a day/full day.

It was rewarding when I finally got there, but the process was a real struggle.
